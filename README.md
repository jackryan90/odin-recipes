This recipes website is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes). It is intended to help me practice creating webpages using HTML only-- CSS and Javascript come later. 

By the time I have finished this website, I will have practiced the following skills:
- Setting up HTML boilerplate
- Creating headings
- Separating text into paragraphs
- Creating ordered and unordered lists
- Lending text meaning using emphasis and strong tags
- Creating links
- Inserting images
