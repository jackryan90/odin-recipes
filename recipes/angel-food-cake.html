        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Angel food cake is a light, springy sponge cake made with egg 
            whites. It is low-fat and pairs well with berry compote and whipped 
            cream.</p>
        <p>It also happens to be my wife's favorite dessert, so we eat it at 
            least once a year around my house.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup cake flour</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups white sugar, divided</li>
            <li>12 egg whites</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons cream of tartar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Clean and 
                fully dry a 10-inch tube pan.</li>
            <li>Sift together flour, and 3/4 cup sugar, set aside.</li>
            <li>Whip egg whites, along with vanilla, cream of tartar, and salt, 
                in a large bowl to medium stiff peaks. Gradually add remaining 
                3/4 cup sugar while continuing to whip to stiff peaks. When the 
                egg white mixture has reached its maximum volume, fold in the 
                sifted ingredients gradually, 1/3 at a time. Do not overmix. 
                Put the batter into the tube pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cake springs back when 
                touched, 40 to 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Balance the tube pan upside down on the top of a bottle to 
                prevent decompression while cooling. When cool, run a knife 
                around the edge of the pan and invert onto a plate.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <p>Be sure that your 10-inch tube pan is clean and dry. Any amount of 
            oil or residue could deflate the egg whites.</p>
