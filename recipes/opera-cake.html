        <p class="description"><strong>Opera cake</strong> is made with thin
            layers of almond-flour based ("joconde") sponge interleaved with
            layers of buttercream frosting. It is often flavored with coffee
            syrup and covered with a top layer of chocolate.</p>

            <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
            <hr>
            <ol>
                <li>For the chocolate ganache, pour the cream into a small pan and
                    bring to a simmer. Meanwhile tip the chocolate into a heatproof
                    bowl. Pour the cream over the chocolate and leave to stand for
                    2 minutes. Stir the cream and chocolate together until
                    emulsified, then stir in the butter to a smooth shiny ganache.
                    Set aside to thicken.</li>
                <li>Heat the oven to 210°C/190°C fan/410°F/Gas 7. Line two baking
                    sheets with non-stick baking paper and lightly spray with cake
                    release spray.</li>
                <li>For the joconde, whisk the ground almonds, 150g of the caster
                    sugar and the eggs together to ribbon stage.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites and the remaining 75g
                    of caster sugar together, to a stiff meringue.</li>
                <li>Gently fold the meringue mixture into the almond mixture. Sieve
                    the flour over the top of the mixture and gently fold in.
                    Finally, gently fold in the melted butter.</li>
                <li>Spread two thirds of the batter onto one of the lined baking
                    sheets and spread level with a palette knife. You will need to
                    cut two 23cm x 17cm rectangles from the sheet of sponge once
                    baked.</li>
                <li>Pour the remaining sponge batter over one half of the other
                    lined baking sheet and spread thinly and level with a palette
                    knife. You will need to cut one rectangle measuring 23cm x 17cm
                    from this sheet of sponge.</li>
                <li>Bake for 9-11 minutes until springy, but firm to the touch.
                    Remove from the oven and leave to cool on a wire rack.</li>
                <li>For the soaking syrup, place the water and sugar in pan and
                    bring to the boil. Reduce the heat, simmer for 2 minutes then
                    remove from the heat. Add the coffee essence then cool and
                    chill until cold.</li>
                <li>For the French buttercream, tip the eggs yolks into the bowl of
                    an electric food mixer and whisk until pale, thick and
                    creamy.</li>
                <li>Tip the sugar and water into a pan and boil to softball stage
                    (116°C/241°F). Remove from the heat and with the whisk still
                    running, very slowly pour the sugar syrup over the whisked egg
                    yolks. Continue whisking until the mixture is cool to
                    touch.</li>
                <li>Once the egg and sugar mixture is cold, whisk in the softened
                    butter, bit by bit until the mixture thickens.</li>
                <li>Whisk in the coffee extract and set aside.</li>
                <li>To assemble, line a baking sheet with an acetate sheet and
                    lightly grease and line the cake frame with acetate. Remove the
                    baking paper from the sponges and cut three 24cm x 17cm
                    rectangles from the sponges. Melt the chocolate and spread one
                    side of one sponge very thinly with chocolate. Place the
                    sponge, chocolate side down in the base of the lined cake tin
                    and brush the top lightly with coffee syrup.</li>
                <li>Spread half of the chocolate ganache over the sponge and level
                    with a palette knife. Freeze for 10 minutes until set.</li>
                <li>Spread half of the coffee buttercream over the ganache and
                    level with a palette knife, then top with a second sponge.
                    Brush with coffee syrup.</li>
                <li>Spread the remaining ganache over the sponge and freeze for 10
                    minutes, until set.</li>
                <li>Spread the remaining coffee buttercream over the chocolate
                    ganache and top with the remaining sponge. Brush with coffee
                    syrup. Chill in the fridge for 30 mins.</li>
                <li>For the chocolate decoration, temper the chocolate by melting
                    120g of chocolate in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water
                    to 45°C/113°F. Remove the bowl from the heat and add the
                    remaining 60g of chocolate. Stir until the chocolate cools to
                    28°C/82°F. Return the bowl of cooled chocolate to the pan and
                    stir until the temperature reaches 32°C/90°F.</li>
                <li>Lay the sheets of acetate (with the pattern facing upwards)
                    over the base of a damp baking sheet (the damp surface will
                    keep the acetate from moving around).</li>
                <li>Spread the chocolate over the acetate strips. Comb the
                    chocolate with the chocolate comb creating long strips. Curl
                    them into a loose spiral, like a pigtail, and place inside the
                    glasses until set.</li>
                <li>For the chocolate glaze, tip the cream, sugar and liquid
                    glucose into a clean pan and bring to a simmer. Meanwhile tip
                    the chocolate into a heatproof jug. Pour the warm cream over
                    the chocolate stirring continually to a smooth glaze.</li>
                <li>Remove the opera from the fridge and pour the glaze over the
                    top and spread evenly with a palette knife. Chill for 10
                    minutes, or until set.</li>
                <li>Demould the opera and place on the serving plate provided. Once
                    set, remove the chocolate twists from the acetate and arrange
                    on top of the opera cake.</li>
