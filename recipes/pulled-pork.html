        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Place pork shoulder in a large pot and add enough apple cider 
                to cover. Combine white sugar, brown sugar, salt, paprika, 
                onion powder, black pepper, and garlic powder in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Mix 1/4 cup of sugar rub into cider; reserve remaining rub. 
                Cover the pot and refrigerate for 12 hours. Preheat the smoker 
                to 210 degrees F (99 degrees C). Add enough wood chips to the 
                smoker.</li>
            <li>Pour cider brine into the water pan of the smoker; add onion 
                and 1/4 cup more sugar rub.</li>
            <li>Spread remaining sugar rub over pork shoulder. Transfer pork to 
                the center of the smoker.</li>
            <li>Smoke pork until very tender or until it reaches an internal 
                temperature of 200 degrees F (95 degrees C), about 8 hours. 
                Monitor hickory chips and liquid, adding more as needed.</li>
            <li>Transfer pork to a large platter and let it rest for 30 minutes 
                before shredding with forks.</li>
